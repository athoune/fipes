# How to contribute

The best way to make sure your issue is addressed is to submit a patch. Patches
are accepted through pull requests, and email.

However, before sending a patch, please make sure that the following applies:

* Your commit message links to that issue.
* Your commit message is descriptive enough.
* Your patch doesn't have useless merge commits.
* Your coding style is similar to the project.
* You follow the branching model below (it's simple, you'll see).
* You understand that we're super grateful for your patch :)

## Branches

The project use a fairly simple model of branches:

* `master` is the "stable" version. In other words, anyone should be
  able to clone the master branch and have a running application in a minute.
  This branch should never be broken.
* `develop` is the "trunk" version. By definition this branch is fairly
  instable and can be broken. This is where people want to hack.

Topic branches should be used as much as possible.
